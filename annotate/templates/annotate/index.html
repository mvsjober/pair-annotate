<p class="lead">Thank you for accepting to give some of your time to help us in our research!</p>

<p>We are interested in understanding what makes a video interesting when trying to illustrate a web site. More specifically, our use case involves helping professionals to illustrate a Video on Demand (VOD) web site by selecting some interesting video excerpts for the movies. The video excerpts should be suitable in terms of helping a user to make his/her decision about whether he/she is interested in watching the whole movie.</p>


<p>During this test you will see several pairs of short videos. You will be asked to make a choice on the basis of the following context: Imagine you are selecting interesting movies to watch on the basis of short clips extracted from these movies.</p>

<h2>Which video makes you more interested in watching the whole movie?</h2>

<br/>
<p>Some pairs will be easier for you to decide than others. But don't worry, there is no right or wrong answer, please follow your feelings.</p>

<p>A video often goes with some audio information. Please be sure that you have devices that will also allow you to listen to the content before you start voting.</p>

<p>Also, you wonâ€™t be able to vote for one video or another before you have watched both of them. On the other hand, you are free to watch them as many times as you feel you need to make your decision.</p>

<p>You will be able to stop the test at any time, just by clicking the stop button. But the more comparisons you do, the more valuable data we will have to conduct our research!</p>

<p>Ready? </p>
